This directory contains all of he quick add buttons that are used in form to speed up the insertion of an item on a pinch. These buttons return the item and refresh the lists on the client.

They work by posting to the server the data and instead of refetching everything they just use the name and id to refresh the list client side. 

They differ from regular "add-new" buttons because those are usually used in page specific applications.
